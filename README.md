1- Airline passenger satisfaction: In this project, I created a classification model to assist airlines in determining whether or not their customers will be satisfied after the journey based on 20 factors such as gender, age, distance, trip type, and customer class.

2- House Prices: In this project, I created a model to forecast house prices depending on location, total number of rooms, house age, and household income.
<br />

3-Used Cars: In this project, I created a model to forecast used car prices based on brand, model year, driven mileage, engine power, and automobile maximum power.
